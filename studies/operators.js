/*
* OPERATORS
*
* 1. Assignment operators - 
*    Assignment operators are used to assign values to JavaScript variables.
*    The value to the right of the equal sign is passed to the variable on the right. 
*    There are 6 Assignment operators:
*
*    var x = 5;
*    var x += 5;
*    var x -= 5;
*    var x *= 5;
*    var x /= 5;
*    var x %= 5;
*   
* 
*

// Comparison operators
//    These operators compare two values.
//     == 
5 == "5"; // Equal to, but not strictly
5 === 5;   // Strictly equal in value and type
       
>	greater than
<   less than
>=	greater than or equal to	
<=	less than or equal to

* Logical operators


&&	and	(x < 10 && y > 1) is true
||	or	(x === 5 || y === 5) is false
!	not	!(x === y) is true

* Unary operators (!, typeOf, -)
! Bang
typeOf 
The typeof operator returns the type of a variable, object, function or expression:
typeof "John"  // Returns string
- delelete ?




* Ternary operator (a ? b : c)
