* 
* If
* An if statement checks IF a condition is true and if it is, it will execute a block
* of code. if it is not true it will look to see if there are any other else-if statments
* and if not will return false
Else-if
  Else-if can be added to an if statement to check for one or more conditions. 
  when an else-if follows a false if statement, the else-if statment will check 
  if it's conditions are true and if so, execute a block of code, much like an if statment.
  
Else
  Else takes no conditions, and will execute a block of code if all other statements
  (if, else-if) that are above it in the stack return false. It's the default. 
Switch
Switch statments takes a value, and compare it to a stack of other values and returns a boolean. 
If the value given to the switch statement is compare to a equal value, it will retun true.
