/*
* DATA TYPES:
*
* 0. There are 12 different data types used in Javascript. They are listed and explained as follows:
*
* 1. Numbers - Numbers are a primitive data type, that consists of all real numbers.
*    i.e. -1, 0, 1, 1.5, 24.98, and 1,000,000,000, etc.  They take up the largest amount of bit space 
*    when stored as data by your program, compared to the other data types, at 8 bits. 
* 2. Strings - Strings are a primititve data type that consists of a series of characters in quotation 
*    marks. These strings can be manipluated (joined, spit, uppercased, etc) and their individual 
*    characters can be accesed by using a zero index. 
* 3. Boolean - A boolean is a datatype that is either true or false.  This is a primitive datatype that 
*    and can be described as an on/off switch.  It's either 1 | 0.  It's also takes up the smallest
*    amount of space when stored, coming in at one bit. 
* 4. Array - an array is a complex datatype, that can store a set of ordered data consisting of other datatypes.
*    arrays are deleniated with [], and can store strings numbers and other arrays within them seperated by commas. 
*    Arrays can be accessed with using zero index. 
* 5. Object - Objects are complex data types that hold data in key/value pairs. An object is deleniated
*    with {}.  Within the brackets, they key/value pairs are seperated by commas. To access a value 
*    stored within an object, you can call on it's key.  values can be any kind of datatype. 
* 6. Functions - 
* 7. undefined - There are 2 phases of using variables: declaration and initialization (or assignment).
* 8. null
* 9. NaN - NaN is a acronym for Not a number. This is a data type that is similar to a number,
*          a number data-type, but returns undefined.
* 10.Infinity and -Infinity
* 11. What is the difference between primitive/simple and complex data types?
* 12. Primitive values are passed to a function BY COPY, complex values are BY REFERENCE. What does that mean, and how are they different?
